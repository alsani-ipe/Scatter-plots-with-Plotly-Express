# Scatter-plots-with-Plotly-Express
Plotly Express is the easy-to-use, high-level interface to Plotly, which operates on a variety of types of data and produces easy-to-style figures. The plotly.express module (usually imported as px) contains functions that can create entire figures at once, and is referred to as Plotly Express or PX.
